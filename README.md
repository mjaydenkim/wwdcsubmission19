# ReGest
This is my WWDC19 scholarship submission. It is my first one, and this is the first thing I have created with Swift (2 weeks ago, I didn't know a line of it.)

# What does the app do? ðŸ¤”
The app is a gesture-based app. You must repeat gestures after the announcer says them on your screen. It gets more difficult as you advance.

# Why did I do this? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
For years and years, since 2015 when I was a young kid, I would run home to watch the keynote. I would sit down on the couch and just watch the whole thing without moving, only to get water. I loved watching the events. So when I had the opportunity to make it in with coding ability, I took up the chance! I learned Swift and put together a simple little game to submit, the finished product of which is right here on this repository!

# What does it look like? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
I recorded a video of myself playing ReGest, here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4AFukITt_k&t=1s

Thanks for checking out my project! Wish me luck!
